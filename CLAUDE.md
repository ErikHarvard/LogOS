# LogOS

A self-hosting operating system whose native language is **Lingua Adamica** — a
small untyped lambda calculus written in glyphs.

**Core axiom:** `∃(∃) ≡ ∃` — existence applied to existence is existence. The
host program, applied to itself, reproduces itself.

## Layout

| File                 | Role                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tiny_host.c`        | The host: a minimal C interpreter for `.la` files.                  |
| `kernel.la`          | The kernel, written in Lingua Adamica. Defines `MAIN`.              |
| `build.sh`           | Compiles the host, runs the kernel, verifies generational replication. |
| `new_logos_genN_pidP.bin` | Output of `copy_self` — generation `N`, replicated by PID `P`; a byte-identical copy of the running host. |

## Lingua Adamica

A `.la` file is a sequence of glyph definitions:

```
glyph NAME = EXPR
```

Expressions:

- **variable** — `x`, `∃`, `SELF` (any UTF-8 name; glyphs are first-class)
- **lambda** — `la x. body`
- **application** — `f(x)` (left-associative: `f(x)(y)` = `(f(x))(y)`)
- **string literal** — `"hello"` (supports `\n \t \\ \"`)
- **grouping** — `( EXPR )`
- `#` begins a line comment

### Built-ins

- `print(s)` — prints string `s` followed by a newline; returns `s`.
- `copy_self(x)` — copies `/proc/self/exe` to `new_logos_gen{N+1}_pid{P}.bin`,
  where `N` is the running host's own generation and `P` is its PID (mode 0755);
  writes the chosen path to stderr and returns it as a string. The host reads
  its generation from its own filename via `/proc/self/exe`: a binary named
  `new_logos_genN...` is generation `N`, and the compiled `tiny_host` progenitor
  is generation 0. The `gen` number therefore encodes true ancestral depth,
  while the PID keeps two replications by the same parent as distinct sibling
  files instead of overwriting each other. The child name is always different
  from the parent's, so a host never tries to overwrite its own live executable
  (which the OS forbids with `ETXTBSY`) and can replicate even when run directly.
  The argument is evaluated for ordering but otherwise ignored.

### Evaluation

The host parses the file into an AST, finds the `MAIN` glyph, and reduces it.
Reduction is eager (call-by-value) with **capture-avoiding substitution**:
when a beta reduction would let a free variable of the argument be captured by
an inner binder, that binder is alpha-renamed to a fresh `_gN` name first.
Glyph names resolve against the global table; `print`/`copy_self` resolve as
built-ins if not shadowed by a glyph.

Sequencing of effects uses `SEQ = la a. la b. b`: naming `a` forces its
effects before `b` is produced, so `SEQ(print(WORD))(copy_self(SELF))` speaks
the Word and *then* replicates.

## Build & run

```sh
./build.sh            # compile, boot kernel.la, verify replication
./tiny_host           # defaults to kernel.la
./tiny_host other.la  # run a different program
```

`build.sh` succeeds only if the kernel prints `I AM THAT I AM`, `new_logos.bin`
is created and is byte-identical to `tiny_host`, and a second-generation copy
reproduces the same Word and the same bytes.

## Extending

- New built-ins: add to `is_builtin` and `apply_builtin` in `tiny_host.c`.
- New language forms: extend the lexer (`lex`), parser (`parse_*`), the `Node`
  AST, `eval`, and `subst` together — substitution and evaluation must agree on
  every node kind.
- The host is intentionally leak-tolerant (a short-lived bootstrap process); if
  LogOS grows long-running programs, add reference counting or an arena/GC.
